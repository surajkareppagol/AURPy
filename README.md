## Why one more AUR helper ?

It is just a hobby project, i came across `Aurweb RPC Interface` and wanted to use it, and see if i could create one (AUR Helper).

## How to use it ?

Here `Poetry` is used for dependency management and packaging in Python, install it by visiting  [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#:~:text=Poetry%20is%20a%20tool%20for,build%20your%20project%20for%20distribution.).

Next clone this repository,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/surajkareppagol/AURPy
cd AURPy
```

```bash
poetry init
```

```bash
poetry install
```

Once all the dependecies are installed,

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py [Package]
```

> **Warning**: This is a hobby project, something might go wrong.
